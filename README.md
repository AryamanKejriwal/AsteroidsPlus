# AsteroidsWithGravity
Play the iconic game, Asteroids, but with a twist!

Asteroids attract each other gravitationally and physically interact with each other when they crash.
Player movement is also possible.

Press space to shoot, 'a' and 'd' to rotate space ship and 'w' to move in the direction of the space ship.

Works with Processing 3.
